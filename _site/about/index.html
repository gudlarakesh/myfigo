    <h2>About us</h2>
    <h4>
In 2012 we, three engineering friends decided to build a sustainable business model in the transportation segment which could have a tremendous impact on society. This was after we had researched and discussed over 50 odd such models in various other sectors.
The first problem we decided to solve was to reduce back pain and butt numbness while riding long distances. We could see a 
solution by integrating air based suspension with an adjustable back rest. Thus began the journey of Feel Good Innovations. </h4>

 
<h4>
  We would like to innovate at every level in the business model and we design, manufacture & sell unique accessories to enhance ride experience. The company is planning to blend the latest technologies (IOT, Mobility platforms) with the products and provide superior services to customers.</h4> 
<h4> 
Born in Hyderabad, we are incubated in National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. The company’s vision is to make life easy on Indian Roads and aspire to touch the lives of at least 2 MN riders by 2018.
